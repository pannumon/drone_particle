# drone_particle
particle (arduino) codes for drone course

A small code that reads DHT11 data using Particle Electron and sends the data to hivemq using MQTT protocol.

Copy pasted from other codes.

Integrated blue led on the board is lit if DHT outputs data (also pre-configured for additional led).
